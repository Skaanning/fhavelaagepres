## Agenda
- Functional programming intro
- FP Basics 
- OO Basics (super quick)
- Type system - Domain modeling 
- Quick look at some exciting features
    - Unit of meassures
    - Type providers
    - DSLs with Computation expressions

---
#### FP intro
- Functions are things
- NO mutability
- Currying
- Everything is an expression
- Algebraic types

---
#### F# FP Basics
bascis part 1 - 3.

#### Object orientering i F# #
- OO in F#
    - basics-oo
- F# && C#  #
    - how do they talk to each other "shareCode.sln"


---
#### Unit of meassures
mm / cm / m / km
EUR / DKK / USD
etc.

---
#### Domain driven design 
composition

how cool are union types

make invalid states impossible to represent.

---
#### Another way of handling errors 
stupid error checking in my pretty code

---
#### Type providers
html example? inRiver?

---
#### Computation expressions (monads?)
find a fun computation expr - fizzbuzz computation?
